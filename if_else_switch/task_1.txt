Task 1:
1) Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code

filename: if-else-switch_a.c


2) Complete this code to print the output below 

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
/* more headers goes there */

/* betty style doc for function main goes there */
int main(void)
{
	int n;

	srand(time(0));
	n = rand() - RAND_MAX / 2;
	/* your code goes there */
	return (0);
}

The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line

filename: if-else-switch_b.c






3) Write a program to get the user First and last name, score. If the result of the score divided by 2 is not up to 50%, the output should be: 
"Sorry you're out".
If the result divided by half is greater than 50%, but not up to 80, the output should be:
"You did well, Unfortunately you'll have to apply for the next cohort"
If the result divided by half is greater than 80%  and lesser than 179%, the output should be:
"Congratulations, You're through to the next phase".

4) Write a program to assign classes to different student based on their age.
If age is 6:
"Class 1"
If age is 8:
"Class 2"
If age is 10:
"Class 3"
If age is 12:
"Class 4"
If age is 14:
"Class 5" 
If age is 16:
"Class 6"
If age is 18:
"Class 8"
else
"Sorry, you do not belong to any class"
